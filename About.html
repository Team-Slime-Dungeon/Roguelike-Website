            <h2>Procedural Dungeon Generation</h2>
            <p>One of the main features of the game is the procedural
                dungeon generation feature which randomly generates
                different floors all with various room sizes, hallways,
                and environmental tiles. Every fifth floor is arranged
                with a different theme, therefore each floor is generated
                with their corresponding environmental tile. The
                procedural dungeon generation feature allows for
                replaybility as each floor is never the same.</p>

            <p>Monsters are randomly generated and move according to
                their own characteristics. Slimes will roam the dungeon
                and chase only when player is nearby. Bush monsters will
                stay stationary, but will chase player once in range.
                Treants will always remain stationary, attacking in a
                stationary position if player is nearby.</p>

                encounter the last obstacle: the King Slime! The King Slime
                is an enlarged slime monster with significantly more health
                than your ordinary slime. Not only does it have more health,
                but once it reaches a certain health threshold, it will send
                out its minion slimes to deter the player from clearing the
                dungeon. Once the the boss is defeated, the player would
                have successfully cleared the dungeon and a scoreboard will
                appear, showcasing all the treasures that the player has
                collected and displaying the total score.</p>
